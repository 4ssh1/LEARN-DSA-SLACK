# Week 02: Two Pointers - Problems

## Problem Set

### Problem 1: Valid Palindrome
**Difficulty:** Easy

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

**Example:**
```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5
- s consists of printable ASCII characters

### Problem 2: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
**Difficulty:** Medium

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

**Example:**
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Index1 is 1, index2 is 2.
```

**Constraints:**
- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in ascending order

### Problem 3: Container With Most Water
**Difficulty:** Medium

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container such that the container holds the most water.

**Example:**
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The maximum area is between index 1 and 8.
```

### Problem 4: 3Sum
**Difficulty:** Medium

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

---

### Problem 5: Reverse String
**Difficulty:** Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
