# Week 02: Two Pointers

## Overview

The two pointers technique is a powerful approach for solving array and string problems. It involves using two indices or pointers to traverse the data structure, typically from opposite ends or at different speeds.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand when to use the two pointers technique
- Implement two pointers from both ends
- Implement slow and fast pointer approach
- Solve classic two pointer problems
- Optimize solutions using two pointers

## Concepts

### Two Pointers from Both Ends
- Start with pointers at the beginning and end
- Move towards the center based on conditions
- Useful for finding pairs, validating sequences

### Slow and Fast Pointers
- One pointer moves faster than the other
- Detect cycles, find middle element
- Common in linked list problems

### Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(n) in most cases
- Space: O(1) - constant space

## Problems

See [problems.md](problems.md) for this week's challenges.

## Resources

- [Two Pointers Template](../../templates/two-pointers-template.md)
- [Solution Approaches](solutions/)
- [Community Solutions](community-solutions/)
- [Explanations](explanations/)

## Tips

1. Identify if the problem involves pairs or sequences
2. Consider if sorting would help
3. Think about what condition moves each pointer
4. Validate edge cases (empty, single element, duplicates)
