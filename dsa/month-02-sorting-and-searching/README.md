## Key Concepts

### Sorting Algorithms Comparison

| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space | Stable |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes |
| Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | No |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n) | No |
| Heap Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(1) | No |

### Searching Algorithms

**Linear Search:** O(n) - works on unsorted arrays
**Binary Search:** O(log n) - requires sorted array

## Learning Path

1. **Weeks 5-6:** Understand how sorting works
2. **Implementation:** Practice coding each algorithm
3. **Comparison:** Know when to use which sort
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Master binary search patterns
5. **Application:** Solve real problems using these techniques
