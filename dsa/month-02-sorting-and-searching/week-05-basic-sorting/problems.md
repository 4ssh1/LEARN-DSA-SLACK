# Week 05: Basic Sorting - Problems

## Problem Set

### Problem 1: Implement Bubble Sort
**Difficulty:** Easy

Implement the bubble sort algorithm. Sort an array in ascending order using bubble sort.

**Example:**
```
Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

---

### Problem 2: Implement Selection Sort
**Difficulty:** Easy

Implement the selection sort algorithm. Sort an array in ascending order using selection sort.

**Example:**
```
Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

---

### Problem 3: Implement Insertion Sort
**Difficulty:** Easy

Implement the insertion sort algorithm. Sort an array in ascending order using insertion sort.

**Example:**
```
Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

---

### Problem 4: Sort Array by Parity
**Difficulty:** Easy

Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 5000

---

### Problem 5: Height Checker
**Difficulty:** Easy

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights. Let this ordering be represented by the array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student. You are given an array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in the current order.

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

**Example:**
```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: heights: [1,1,4,2,1,3], expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= heights.length <= 100
- 1 <= heights[i] <= 100
