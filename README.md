## How to Contribute

### Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repository** - Create your own copy on GitHub
2. **Clone Your Fork** - Download to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4ssh1/LEARN-DSA-SLACK.git
   cd dsa
   ```
3. **Create a Branch** - Use a descriptive branch name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-python-solution-two-sum
   ```

### Adding Solutions
1. Navigate to the relevant week folder (e.g., `dsa/month-01-arrays-and-strings/week-01-array-basics/`)
2. Go to the `solutions/` folder and choose your language (python, cpp, javascript, csharp)
3. Create or update your solution file following the naming convention
4. Add corresponding tests in the `tests/` subfolder
5. Ensure your code runs without errors

### Submitting Your Contribution
1. **Commit Your Changes** - Use clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Python solution for two_sum"
   ```
2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-python-solution-two-sum
   ```
3. **Create a Pull Request** - Go to the main repository and open a PR with:
   - Clear title (e.g., "Add Python solution for two_sum")
   - Description of your changes
   - Reference to related issues if any
4. **Respond to Reviews** - Address feedback from reviewers
5. **Merge** - Once approved, your PR will be merged into main

### Tips for Success
- Check existing solutions before adding yours
- Follow the code style and formatting of your language
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Include comments for complex logic
- Test your solution thoroughly
- Keep commits atomic and focused

  ## ✅ Rules

- One problem per folder → Multiple solutions go inside language subfolders.

- Commit messages should be descriptive.

- Keep code clean & readable → Use proper formatting.
- Do NOT commit directly to main.

- Make sure your code runs without errors.

### 📥 Pull Request Rules

- Always open PRs into main (base branch must be main).

- Your PR will be blocked if it targets any other branch.

- Every PR must be reviewed and approved by someone else before merging.

- Use clear titles like: Add Python solution for two_sum

## 👥 Code Reviews

All PRs will be reviewed before merging.

Reviewers may request changes for formatting, naming, or structure.

Once approved, your PR will be merged into main.

Thanks for contributing.
